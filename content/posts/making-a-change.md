I’ve been dying to write more for this blog, but I’ve been stuck in an infinite loop of perfectionism.

<!--more-->

I’ve been beset by impostor syndrome, hoping to be more well read, more witty, more something other than what I am.

Well, I’ve decided to stop that. Fuck that in fact. Instead of trying to be polished, I’ve decided to take a page from a favorite [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Dw9TFdbPJoTDMSiJdIQTA) and just spew out my reading list and my thoughts at you.

This blog after all is a vanity project in which I, do to my lack of friends who really want to listen to me talk for hours a day, write out what I’m thinking. 

So prepare for some un-varnishing.
